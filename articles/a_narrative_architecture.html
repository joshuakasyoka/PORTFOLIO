        <div class="text"><p>One of the major challenges of representing the suffering experienced by others is that normal chronological temporalities are often disrupted, and can become fragmentary and disorientating. In order to give expression to others’ pain then, writers are often forced to find innovative and creative ways to give figurative shape to the temporal confusion which is resultant when conflict is experienced or translated into words. The graphic novel, in the complex architecture of its pages, where a sense of time is created through the spatial layout of individual panels, allows for these complex temporalities to be represented. Indeed, Thierry Groensteen, a prominent comics theorist, has highlighted the unique way in which time operates in graphic novels, saying: ‘the position of a panel in the page corresponds to a particular moment in the unfolding of the story’ and that ‘each new panel hastens the story and, simultaneously, holds it back’ (Groensteen 35). As such, the writer of the graphic novel is able to manipulate the unfolding of time, and present it in the fragmentary and juxtaposing ways necessary for the representation of conflict. Scott McCloud, whose comics theory, this chapter will use along with Groensteen’s, has similarly articulated this as the way ‘panels fracture both time and space, offering a jagged staccato rhythm of unconnected moments’ (McCloud 67). In Maus Spiegelman uses this feature of the graphic novel to convey the way in which victims of trauma, like his father Vladek, experience the past and present as complicatedly entwined with one another. Lefèvre’s The Photographer is similarly able to unpack the difficult temporalities of photographs of conflict. Through the careful composition of both graphic and photographic panels on the page, he encourages the reader to ‘stop looking at photographs and instead start watching’ them (Azoulay 14). And finally, Sacco’s Palestine utilises the graphic novel’s spatio-topical system to convey the way in which Palestinians are victims of ‘slow violence’, a term Rob Nixon uses to refer to violence which has been rendered invisible due to the passing of time (Nixon 3). In short then, this chapter is an exploration into the ways in which the complex temporalities of violence and conflict, are productively represented in the graphic novel due to its unique temporal-spatial system. It is well established among trauma theorists, that in many cases, victims of trauma experience little distance between a moment of past suffering and the present. Ernst Van Alphen, for example, has noted how survivors of the Holocaust are susceptible to traumatic re-enactment, whereby ‘the original traumatic event has not yet been transformed into a mediated, distanced account’ but rather ‘re-imposes itself in its visual and sensory directness’ (Van Alphen 211). In its careful juxtaposition of past and present, Maus has been praised by numerous literary critics for the innovative and accurate way in which it portrays the experience of trauma victims as bound to their past. Andreas Huyssen has commented on how ‘historical and personal trauma’ are effectively ‘knotted together’ in the story, and Rosemary Hathaway has written about the way in which the ‘text reveals how powerfully the past influences the present’ (Huyssen, Of Mice and Mimesis 71) (Hathaway 250). Indeed, through his manipulation of the features of the graphic novel, Spiegelman is able to partly overcome the difficulty of representing the temporal complexity of trauma. In an interview, he states that comics are ‘about time being made manifest spatially’, and that this allows him to juxtapose past and present to depict ‘different times inhabiting the same space’ (Silverblatt 35) This device is used throughout the text, but is perhaps most effectual in a scene where Vladek is telling Artie about an incident in 1931, when the Germans ‘took four Jews away for dealing goods without coupons’, and made an example of them by leaving them to hang for ‘one full week’ on ‘Modrezejowska Street’ (Spiegelman 85). Spiegelman first emphasises the length of ‘one full week’ by providing one large frame containing a full picture of the hung Jews, followed by two smaller frames, which show only their dangling feet. The two smaller panels are separated by what Scott McCloud calls ‘moment-to-moment’ closure, whereby ‘very little’ action occurs between the frames (McCloud 74). The effect of this, is that the reader is forced to linger on the scene, and slow their pace of reading. In positioning the panels at the bottom right of the page, Spiegelman further uses what comic theorists term, a turn-page-reveal, which allows for a dramatic change of rhythm or scene on the next page. Indeed, Spiegelman presents three panels which depict a conversation between Artie and Vladek in present-time, where Vladek says: ‘Ach. When I think now of them, it still makes me cry […] look even from my dead eye tears are coming out’ (Spiegelman 86). Using the spatio-topical system of the graphic novel, Spiegelman thus juxtaposes past: the lingering frames depicting the four hung Jews, and present: Vladek becoming emotional at the memory. The ultimate effect, is that the reader is forced to consider the way in which for Vladek, this traumatic event is not ‘transformed into a mediated, distanced account’, but rather it exists in ‘visual and sensory directness’ (Van Alphen 211). In an essay on memory Aledia Assman has further commented on the way in which, for victims of trauma, memory is often ‘acquired by collective instruction, it is the site of continuous learning and acquisition of both general and specialized knowledge’ (Assman 36). She proposes that the individual does not always ‘preserve an original stimulus’ but rather creates their past through a ‘process of continuous re-inscription and reconstruction’ (39). In this sense traumatic timelines are not a string of linear events but a self-conception which depends on multiple different sources and fragmented temporalities. In Maus Spiegelman represents this model of traumatic memory, as he says, by ‘giving form to his father’s words and narrative’ through ‘panel size, panel rhythms, and visual structures on the page’ (Chute, The shadow of a past time 200). Indeed, the comics medium, in its composition using ‘interdependent images’, which when placed together create meaning, allow for multiple narrative voices, and sources to be individually presented on the page. Groensteen explains this in other words, saying: ‘the page is divided into randomly sectioned fragments’ which are ordered ‘according to an architectural perspective’ (Groensteen 34). As such, the process by which a traumatic memory, based on ‘re-inscription and ‘reconstruction’ is created, can be effectively presented in the graphic novel. When Artie is asking Vladek about the ‘bunkers’ that he had to build in order to avoid capture by the Germans, the memory is created by Spiegelman through a combination of both Vladek’s words, and a sketch which he draws. Vladek says: ‘I arranged for us a very good hiding spot in our cellar, where it was coal storage … show to me your pencil and I can explain’ (Spiegelman 112). The memory of the ‘bunker’ is therefore represented by Spiegelman as heterogeneous: one half of the double-page shows a visual rendering of the bunker, and above, Vladek’s verbal narrative account of how he built it. On the following page, Spiegelman combines the two sources and incorporates it into his more complete narrative account of Vladek’s experience while in the Srodula Ghetto. The comics medium therefore allows Spiegelman to show the way in which memory is an architectural formation, and subject to constant ‘reconstruction’. Indeed, towards the end of Maus while Artie is asking Vladek about his release from Auschwitz, Vladek states: ‘all such things of the war, I tried to put out from my mind once and for all … until you rebuild me all this from your questions’ (258). Time in Maus is therefore represented a series of fragmented moments, which more accurately depict the way in which memory and trauma are experienced. It is only through the form of the graphic novel, with its sense of temporality being created through juxtaposing panels, that Spiegelman is so effectively able to show this. In a similar way to how Maus uses the graphic novel to represent the difficult temporalities of trauma and memory, in The Photographer Lefèvre attempts to overcome the atemporality of war photography to illicit a more emotional response from the viewer. Ariella Azoulay has argued that ‘photography is much more than what is printed on the photographic paper. The photograph bears the seal of the photographic event, and reconstructing this event requires more than just identifying what is shown in the photograph’ (Azoulay 14). Susan Sontag, however, has pointed out that in most cases a photograph ‘flares up, is shared by many people, and fades from view’, and our mode of looking, whether or not we mean it to be, becomes an act of voyeurism (Sontag). How then, as Azoulay notes, do we start ‘watching’ photographs, and reinscribe them with a sense of temporality that encourages the reader to engage with the conflict that they depict. In The Photographer Lefèvre places his photographs of Afghanistan in amongst non-photographic panels, thereby narrativising them and reconstructing their complex temporality on the page. In a village called Püstük, which ‘has been spared by … bombs’, Lefèvre photographs many injured civilians, and on one particular page of the graphic novel, he enlarges a picture of a badly injured boy of ‘maybe two or three’ (Lefèvre 129, 132). Looking at the photograph, the reader can extrapolate that the boy is injured, but not how badly, and the identity of the girl beside him (perhaps his mother) cannot be known. It is a powerful photograph, but it is almost impossible to establish its timeline. Teju Cole suggests this is common of photographs of war, where there are often questions which are ‘hard to answer only by looking at the photograph’ (Cole). Through the comics medium, however, Lefèvre provides the photograph with a sense of movement. In the preceding panels, he shows the sounds the boy is making: ‘a little wail of aoh’, and a few pages later, we learn from Juliette, of the child’s death. She exclaims: ‘He must have had internal bleeding’ and ‘the mother said to me, ‘film it, Jamilia. People have to know’’ (Lefèvre 136). Scott McCloud, has argued that comics force the ‘human imagination’ to take ‘two separate images and transform them into a single idea’ (McCloud 67). What Lefèvre is achieving then, by accompanying his photographs with non-photographic panels, is a sense of narrative, or ‘single idea’, which allows the reader, or viewer, to overcome the atemporality of photographs, and engage with the suffering experienced by the people in them. Indeed, Susan Sontag has noted that ‘to photograph is to frame, and to frame is to exclude’ and that ‘narrative seems likely to be more effective than an image’ (Sontag). The graphic novel can therefore be seen partly as a solution on how to take a photograph, and inscribe it with a sense of time, as Azoulay says, to establish that it represents more than just a piece of paper, but the real-life suffering of other individuals. The comics medium further allows for time to expand or contract depending on the layout of panels on the page. Or more specifically, as Groensteen points out, ‘a panel is not presented as isolated. It participates in a series (most often sequential, or narrative) offered to the reader’, and it is up to the writer to determine the rhythm of reading, depending on the placement of these panels (Groensteen 47, 61). This feature of the graphic novel is utilized by Lefèvre to engage the reader in specific moments of conflict depicted in his photographs. He prevents them being viewed as static, and reinscribes them with a particular sense of time. Indeed, Nancy Pedri has commented on this in her analysis of the The Photographer, saying ‘the temporal implications of the photographic sequence are restated and the narrative details expanded upon’ (Pedri). This is especially apparent, in a sequence of images presented of a man with a minor wound, which the narrative introduces: ‘that’s a scene I’ve seen a hundred times in the movies: the hero takes a swig of whisky bites down on a piece of wood, and aaarh! They extract the bullet with pliers in one sharp tug … the truth is that the whole things is excruciatingly painful’ (Lefèvre 128). In order to convey the pain the individual feels, Lefèvre presents multiple frames, in quick succession, in the form of a photographic test-sheet. Normally, in comics, as Groensteen explains, ‘the eye’s movement on the surface of the page are relatively erratic and do not respect any precise protocol’, here however, the uniformed presentation of individual panels, forces the reader to engage with the particular incident, and experience a slowing down of time (Groensteen 47). The ‘breathing’ of the reader becomes ‘affected’, and as such, it is possible to reflect more carefully on the conflict the pictures represent (61). Throughout The Photographer a red wax marker is used to indicate the individual exposures from amongst Lefèvre’s test-sheets, which he would have chosen to develop. This is a constant reminder for the reader, that without the contextualization of these photographs using the graphic novel’s distinctive paneling system as a means of creating a sense of time and narrative; these photographs, and the people in them, would be assigned to a temporal void. Indeed, Susan Sontag has pointed out how photography supposedly act as an authentic claim or evidence to the fact that something has happened, but she also notes: ‘evidence of what?’. This, we cannot know, unless, as The Photographer shows, the reader is provided with a narrativised and temporal accompaniment to a photograph.  As such, the comics medium, can be seen to endow photographs with movement, through the layout of the panels spatially across a page, and encourage a genuine engagement with the suffering experienced by others. Overcoming the difficult temporalities of others’ suffering is also an issue in Sacco’s graphic novel: Palestine. Indeed, In Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor (2011) Rob Nixon uses the term ‘slow violence’ to refer to ‘a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space’ (Nixon 2). He explains that not all violence is ‘immediate in time, explosive and spectacular’ but sometimes it occurs gradually and out of sight where ‘casualties are postponed, often for generations’. How then, he asks, is this violence represented, or in other words, how are ‘arresting stories, images, and symbols adequate to the pervasive but elusive violence of delayed effects’ constructed (3). This is a challenge Sacco faces in representing the suffering experienced by Palestinians. Indeed, in the introduction to the book, Edward Said notes that Sacco is confronted with the task of representing a suffering which has its origins firmly grounded in a much overlooked and largely invisible history. He refers to the famous statement made by Golda Meir in the Sunday Times in 1969, in which she said: there was ‘no such thing as Palestinians … it was not as though there was a Palestinians people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinians people’ (Parmenter 20). Thus, Sacco’s Palestine is an attempt to accomplish, through the manipulation of the graphic novel’s spatio-topical system, a reimaging of the violence which currently effects Palestinians, but which also has its origins in the past. In the first chapter, for example, Sacco spatially apposes two pages: one on which a Palestinian refugee in Jabilia tells the story of how his family were forced to flee in 1948, saying ‘The Jews came and occupied the village and arrested everyone left behind …  It was a black day when I left my land’ (Sacco 15). The other page depicts a Jewish American, who says: ‘Well I’m actually American but this feels like home to me’, with Sacco’s interjection about the American: ‘he’s got full Israeli citizenship if he wants, that’s the Law of Return, any Jew from anywhere can ‘return here’’ (14). On two pages then, which the reader can view all at one, Sacco shows the tragedy of the Palestinian situation. While the American-Jew, who has never been to the region before, can claim citizenship, the Palestinian, disposed in 1948, still remains a refugee. Hilary Chute expresses of Sacco’s work that it ‘strives to materialize visually an archive of oral testimony … reconstructing the bodies of others, bodies that have been ignored by official discourse’ (Chute, Comics Form and Narrating Lives 112). Indeed, on this double page, Sacco is able to contrast two different temporal situations (the American’s and the Palestinian’s), to highlight the fact that Palestinians still suffer the consequences of dispossession, even if unseen, while Israel moves on. In short then, he gives form to the invisible suffering of Palestinians, which Nixon explains is characteristic of ‘slow violence’, through his manipulation and juxtaposition of panels in his graphic novel. Talking about comics, Federico Fellini says that ‘more than film’, they benefit ‘from the collaboration of the readers: one tells them a story that they tell to themselves; with their particular rhythm and imagination, in moving forward and backward’ (Groensteen 11). Indeed, using the graphic novel, the writer can ask the reader to imagine time not as linear and chronological, but instead, as something constructed on the page. Through the placement of individual panels spatially, time can be fragmented, and manipulated so as to accommodate more complicated temporal situations. In representing the violence and pain experienced by others, normal temporalities, as this chapter has explained, are disorientated. The graphic-novel’s temporal spatial system, which allows for more flexibility, is thus used in Maus, The Photographer and Palestine in order to better engage their readers with the duration of conflict represented in their respective texts.</p></div>
