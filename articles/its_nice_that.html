        <div class="text"><p>Sarah’s Hawke’s crochet garments are amazingly complicated, full of patterns and colours which, with the amount going on, should look chaotic, but instead they are pieces of technical harmony. Growing up in Ramsgate, her relationship with crochet started one summer when she was faced with the choice of either spending money on clothes or going out with her friends. She tells us “it was like one or the other, and I chose going out and drinking with my friends. If I wanted to go to the beach I had to think really creatively about what I was going to wear and that’s when I picked up crocheting”. Seeing crochet bikinis in shop windows, she thought “yeah I can do that”, watched a couple of tutorials and “picked it up from there”. Getting her first crochet needle from a haberdashery on the highstreet, she says that her initial projects “always focused on the end product” rather than the creative process, and that more or less, she copied directly from the youtubers she was watching.


            So when we ask her what her creative turning point was (clearly she is no longer limited to reproductions) she says, “do you remember the Gucci balaclavas that came out a couple of years ago, they were really cool? Rhianna wore like a Gucci balaclava with like big earrings in the side and obviously she looked fucking stunning. My friend sent me that and was like ‘can you make me something like this’ and I was like shit I can try”. It was getting to grips with the technicalities of making balaclavas that started encouraging Sarah to think more inventively about crochet and to explore the different materials she could use to ensure that they didn’t just look like a “sack around a head”. “Once I got comfortable with the different stitches, she adds “I could kind of go on to my own path and find inspiration and really experiment”.
            No longer a novice, but a visibly talented crocheter, Sarah’s work has caught
            the attention of music artists like Summer Walker, who requested to pull her
            collection for a video project she was working on back in 2019. While the
            technicalities of transporting lovingly crafted garments across the Atlantic ona three day notice meant that the project didn’t come to fruition, her work has featured more recently in the music videos of R&B artist The Only Samba
            and the music hall group, Sun Divas. Her collaborations, predominantly with
            fashion students, have also continued to push her on a technical level. Asked
            to design the headwear for a shoot which she describes as “kind of like 1950s
            housewife meets alien who doesn’t really understand what it’s like to be a
            1950s housewife” Sarah stitched hundreds of crocheted Afghan flowers onto a
            basic balaclava; a project she describes as “really technical” but that got her “a
            lot of kudos from the crochet community”.
            
            Speaking about other crochet artists that have inspired her, Sarah paints a
            picture of a really supportive network. “A lot of people will feed off each other’s ideas” and “whenever there are newcomers that are trying out interesting
            patterns, people who have been in it since day dot will always reshare their
            work”. More simply she adds, “there’s always a bit of collaboration in that sense
            that crocheters fan girl other crocheters”. A great illustration of this community was when she lived in Herne Hill and an old lady living in her block of flats
            saw her crocheting in the communal garden and invited her up, showing her a room with “hundreds of crochet needles in little pots, a book case which was
            like floor to ceiling full of crochet books, yarn and more needles... the ultimate
            work space for a crocheter”. After a cup of tea, she gave Sarah a hand knitted
            jumper with brown writing on it saying ‘this is an original hand knitted top’. ‘I
            was like fuck this must have taken so long” but accepted because it fitted “perfectly... obviously” she laughs.
            
                                
            Sarah’s journey into crochet, however, hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Getting
            her head around the business side of things, she admits, has been a difficult
            process. “I still undersell myself. I am really bad at the admin. I won’t time myself, really. I used to look at what I’d been working on at the end and think that
            maybe took me 20 hours to do and if I want to pay myself London living wage,
            that’s basically like 200 quid, but I’d still end up knocking off 50 quid, which is really dumb”. Now, she says, she is better at pricing her work. “People will
            message me all the time and be like oh I love this top, how much is it? And I’ll
            be like the top is 50 quid, and not really budge from there”. She says “that’s the
            cost of a crochet item”, but when “you get stuff like all the fast fashion labels
            that are like selling crochet items for £3 for a skirt in sale” it makes it difficultto compete with. We ask whether this makes her pessimistic for her future
            projects, but she says “nah, I think you’ve just got to be able to market it in the
            right way, there are people who understand the value of it more and are not
            underselling it”.
            
                                
            In her latest project, she has been working on some baker boy hats in collaboration with another artist looking into black british identity, which has been
            immensely satisfying. She explains “people have started putting the power
            more in my hands, making me feel more like an artist and designer rather than
            someone who just crochets like a machine”.
