        <div class="text"><p>In The New York Times, the critic Josh Greenfield called Stanley Elkin ‘at once a bright satirist, a bleak absurdist and a deadly moralist’ (Grimes). The title of his short story ‘I Look Out for Ed Wolfe’ holds true to this observation in that it darkly ironizes the fact that no one in the entire narrative actually ‘look[s] out for Ed Wolfe’ (Elkin, 344). The character, an ‘orphan’ whose ‘orphan’s features were as true to himself as are their pale, pinched faces to the blind’ is motivated throughout most of the story by an impossible desire to determine his self-worth and make his presence felt. A likely consequence of his early neglect and position on the outskirts of society, where he exists in amongst ‘men desperately but imaginatively failing’ in life (338). Wolfe’s ‘want’ as Kurt Vonnegut puts it, becomes increasingly unattainable however as he complicates his self-worth with monetary value, and obsessively starts pawning off all of his possessions (Vonnegut 9). Elkin uses Wolfe’s struggle to overcome his own annihilation as the principal structuring device for his story; and as his attempts become increasingly futile, the story builds in tension until a point of climax is reached. In The Art of Fiction (1983) Gardner talks about the ‘famous Fichtean curve’ which he describes as a diagram which represents the ‘conflict situation’ in a short story. Absolutely necessary for establishing the moment of conflict is ‘exposition’ (Gardner 187). It is through the representation of Wolfe’s struggles to fulfil his desire, that Elkin creates his story’s exposition, and ultimately facilitates the tipping point, which Gardener outlines as the ‘climactic moment of recognition or understanding on the part of the central character’ (183). As mentioned, this arrives when Ed Wolfe realises he has failed to make himself felt, abandons his initial motivations, and embarks on an absurd rampage of drinking and spending. 

            At the start of the story Elkin sets down the ground work for Ed Wolfe’s character, allowing the reader to comprehend the nature of his desire for self-definition, and the initial ways in which this is unattainable for him. The omniscient narrative tells us that Ed Wolfe ‘was an orphan’ and that ‘to himself, he seemed like one, looked like one’ (Elkin 338). Immediately, we are asked to see through Ed Wolfe’s eyes, and to think of the character how he thinks of himself: abandoned at birth and subsequently anonymous to the world. Indeed, he is described as giving off the impression of ‘ruthless isolation’ and the ‘peculiar dignity of men eating alone in restaurants on national holidays’ (338). The first insight we have into the fact Ed Wolfe desires to overcome his positionality at the outset of society, is that he ‘saved the photographs of strangers and imprisoned them behind clear plastic windows in his wallet’ (338). The bleak image of a man compensating for lack of real life connections by acquiring fictitious ones recurs throughout the story. Later on, for example, we see that he imagines a scene between himself and a piano playing Eddie, who says to him ‘Mistuh Wuf, you don’ wan’ heah dat ol’ song no maw’ (348). But perhaps most tellingly are Ed Wolfe’s efforts for self-improvement; the narrative describes how he ‘strove against himself, a supererogatory enemy, and sought by a kind of helpless abrasion, as one rubs wood, the gleaming self beneath’ (338). He strips himself down - quite literally later on in the story - in order to obtain some form of genuine or authentic personal value and worth, with which he can make his mark on the world. However, we are told that all these efforts are futile for Ed Wolfe, in the ‘sound of his own voice he detected the accent of the night school’, and he is forever unable to obtain ‘the fat, sunny ring’ of the real world (338). Elkin, from the story’s onset therefore establishes Ed Wolfe as a character who wants recognition, but who desperately fails in achieving it. The rest of the exposition is constructed by depicting Ed Wolfe’s struggles in this direction and against his self-erasure. 
            
            The building where Ed Wolfe works is one such obstacle in the way of obtaining his desire, whether the character himself is aware of this or not. Like Wolfe, it exists at the point of other people’s indifference: the landlord has left the place in the hands of outcasts, ‘a strange band of entrepreneurs and visionaries’ which consists of ‘an eye doctor who corrected vision by massage’, ‘a black belt judo champion’ and a ‘radio evangelist’ (338, 339). Most importantly, however, is that Wolfe’s building is described as a place where people deal in the ‘artificial’, the ‘imitated’ and the ‘copied’ (339). What Wolfe desires, as has been established, is recognition and authentication in the real world. While he exists in this ‘outlaw’ building, however, it is impossible that he can obtain any genuine relationships, or self-authentication (338). The first interaction Wolfe has in the story is with Dr Brut, who appears almost like a manikin in the way that he is ‘framed in the arching golden nimbus of his inverted name on the window’ (339). The exchange is surreal, as Dr Brut awkwardly ‘holds him by the elbow’, embarks on a conversation that is brimming with cliché, and appears as if he is being ventriloquized by an absent figure (339). Elkin therefore creates the impression of Wolfe struggling against inauthenticity, and the specious characters which fill his place of work. Indeed, Dr Brut the supposed chiropractor, refers to the legitimate ‘doctors in hospitals, in clinics’ and ‘on boards’ as ‘the bastards downtown’; displaying a deep seated resentment against that which is acknowledged as real and genuine (339). This explains then, why the orphan Ed Wolfe rejects Dr Brut when he jovially suggests, in a half serious way: ‘I’ll adopt you […] we’ll open a clinic. C. Morris Brut and Adopted Son’. Ed Wolfe recoils at the proposition, saying ‘it’s something to think about’ before hurrying off to his offices in ‘Cornucopia Finance Corporation’ (339). Gardner explains that in the exposition, the writer must gradually authenticate his character’s dilemma in order to ‘actualize’ the climax (Gardner 186). Elkin, by representing Wolfe’s efforts to resist and overcome the superficiality of his work, is therefore placing an important expository point in his story which builds tension in anticipation of the climax.
            
                Having established Ed Wolfe as desperately on the peripheries of society, working in a block of offices brimming with counterfeiters, Elkin makes use of dialogue to further highlight the character’s desire for concrete recognition. James Wood explains the importance of dialogue in ‘carrying multiple meanings’ and how ‘we can tell a great deal from a character by how he talks, and whom he talks to, how he bumps up against the world’ (Wood 96). When Wolfe calls up Mr Flay, a struggling customer, the reader can see him immediately brighten at the opportunity for self-assertion; he turns the name of Cornucopia Finance into a sadistic jingle, ‘Can you cope, can you cope?’, before releasing a torrent of abuse at the man who has failed to pay his debts because he is ‘a little short’ of cash (Elkin 340). Ed Wolfe, as his boss La Meck later says, has a ‘real thing for the deadbeat soul’ and is almost an ‘artist’ in his ability to ‘take a guy who’s already down and bury him deeper’ (343). Indeed, he falls into a comfortable but ruthless groove when talking to Mr. Flay, and starts calling him ‘Warsaw’ because he detects that he is polish, and shouts down the phone: ‘You listen. You wanted the car. The refrigerator. The chintzy furniture. The sectional you saw in the funny paper. And we paid for it, right?’ (341). Elkin italicises the word ‘listen’, almost as if to emphasise Ed Wolfe’s desperation for his voice to be heard, to make himself known. The dialogue reveals what the omniscient narration previously has not; the extent to which Ed Wolfe is obsessed with overcoming his anonymity in the world, and his impassioned attempts at asserting his voice, in the form of perverse embittered phone calls. When Wolfe comes off the phone, we see he is exhilarated, and Elkin describes how ‘his chest was heaving’ and how he needed to ‘wipe his face’ (341). His struggle, however, is only just starting, and when he is fired by La Meck because Cornucopia Finance started ‘to get complaints’, Elkin skilfully introduces another barrier for Ed Wolfe to overcome: how to assert himself now without these phone calls (343). Again, by depicting moments of Ed Wolfe’s struggles, and complicating them further, Elkin is placing strain in his story and laying important groundwork for a moment of climactic release, when his protagonist realises he remains unacknowledged in life. 
            
            When Ed Wolfe leaves Cornucopia Finance La Meck says to him ‘Look out for Ed Wolfe’, an articulation of what Elkin has been hinting at in the story up to this point: that Wolfe wants to become an anticipated and acknowledged figure (344). However, without his provisional means of achieving this - by lambasting those in significant debt – he is forced to find other ways to fulfil his ambitions. The solution becomes apparent when he sees the message on a ‘green slip’ that had been ‘shoved under the wiper blade’ of his car: ‘Your car will never be worth more than it is worth right now! Why wait for depreciation to make you automatically bankrupt. I will buy this car and pay you cash!’ (345). Wolfe applies the logic from the ‘green slip’ onto himself, believing that he personally will ‘never be worth more than’ he is now; leading to a bizarre process whereby he pawns off all his possessions for cash. Indeed, he ‘sadly’ contemplates ‘deprecation’, before quickly coming to the solution: ‘I’ll move. I’ll liquidate. I’ll sell out’ (348). As Wolfe begins this course of action, he becomes obsessed with the physical appearance of money, ‘hoping that the four hundred and sixty-three dollars and sixty-five cents’ he hands into the bank will appear ‘his week’s salary to the man who waited behind him’, and creates a quasi-monument out of a pile of a ‘thousand dollars’ on his ‘kitchen table’ (346, 347). The irony of the situation, however, is that by conflating self-worth with monetary value, Wolfe sets himself on a path of self-abrasion, which contrary to his desire, will ultimately lead to his complete anonymity and invisibility to the world. Elkin describes how ‘he sold and he sold, each day spinning of little pieces of himself, like controlled explosions of the sun’ (348). He phones up the book buyer, and sells his collection of over eleven hundred books, calling down the phone ‘I feel as if I’m selling my mind’ (349). This is quickly followed by his records, the ‘Folk. Classical. Broadway. Spoken World’, which prompts him to say ‘I feel as though I’m selling my ears’ (350). And when he moves onto selling his clothes, Elkin emphasises the extent to which Ed Wolfe has existed as an anonymous person, he tells the buyer ‘Those marginal restaurants where you can never remember whether they’ll let you in without a jacket? Well the jackets they lend you in those places always fit me’ (350). Ultimately, Elkin is building tension in his story by presenting the reader with Ed Wolfe’s desperate attempts at self-definition through financial means, and as his scheme of dispossession becomes increasingly hopeless, we are set in place for the story’s climactic tipping point. 
            
            Indeed, with regards to the Fichtean curve, Gardener explains that if the writer has succeeded in building a series of moments of tensions in his exposition, and ‘the denouncement has been properly set up, it falls like an avalanche’ (Gardner 190). Having sold all his possessions, and contemplating: ‘that was what he was worth. That was the going rate for orphans in a wicked world. Something under $2, 500’, he becomes ‘restless’ and ‘panicky’ because he ‘had come to think of his money as his life’ and that ‘spending it was the abrasion again’ (353). On realising this Ed Wolfe reaches his point of crisis. He runs up to a desk clerk and asks desperately ‘Where’s the action?’, and when the clerk responds by looking ‘startled’, he goes up to a man reading The Wall Street journal and again asks, ‘Where’s the action?’ (354). The omniscient narrative tells us that Ed Wolfe ‘felt lousy, awkward, complicated irritated and ashamed’ and that looking at this man it suddenly ‘came to him how completely he had failed to make himself felt’ (355). Throughout the story the phrase ‘Look out for Ed Wolfe’ is uttered by Wolfe, a mantra which reminds him he needs to obtain his desire for recognition. The climactic moment in Elkin’s story comes when Wolfe is described saying: ‘Look out for Ed Wolfe, indeed’ (355). The variation of the phrase, to include the word ‘indeed’, emphasises the protagonist’s failure, and his recognition of this fact too. The final scene of the story follows Ed Wolfe and a man called Oliver, as they move to a club, where Wolfe becomes aggressive and psychotic as a result of his inability to achieve his ‘want’. Elkin presents Wolfe standing on a stage in front of a crowd of people, ironically in the limelight, to shouts of ‘Get down from there’, ‘shut up mister’ and ‘you’re a guest. A guest got no call to talk like that’ (361, 362). The exposition which Elkin has constructed by representing Ed Wolfe struggling to assert himself in the world, builds in tension throughout the story, and it is in these last scenes, when Wolfe meets Oliver, that a tipping point arises and collapses - when all Wolfe’s efforts fail, and we see that in reality, no one ‘look[s] out for Ed Wolfe’ (344). 
            
            When Kurt Vonnegut writes that ‘Every character should want something, even if it’s only a glass of water’, he is highlighting the potential for a character’s desire to drive forward the narrative of a short story (Vonnegut 9). Indeed, in ‘I Look Out for Ed Wolfe’, it is clear that Elkin uses his protagonist’s ‘want’ - to establish his self-worth - as a means of fuelling his story’s overall narrative. The exposition is laid out through representations of the challenges Wolfe faces in achieving his desire: his birth as an orphan, his place at the edge of the legitimate world of work; and his attempts at overcoming them: acting as an aggressive debt collector, and eventually initiating a long process of dispossession, in hope of justifying through cash, his personal value. Having carefully constructed this ‘emotional line’ throughout the story, Elkin sets himself up perfectly for the climax (Gardener 187). In short then, establishing a dynamic whereby a central character struggles to fulfil his desire, is a distinctly effective way for a writer to hold together the overall plot of their short story.</p></div>
