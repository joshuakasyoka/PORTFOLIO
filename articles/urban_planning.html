        <div class="text"><p>How urban spaces are experienced can be seen as determined by the competing ideological standpoints of architects, developers and social activists. Despots like Robert Moses and Le Corbusier represent a ‘top-down’ approach towards city planning, where the ‘surgical removal’ of diverse neighborhoods and their replacement with ‘modern slabs’, are seen as the most efficient way of ensuring progress and improvement in a city. In opposition to this ‘homogenizing clarity’, stands the model of ‘bottom-up’ regeneration, advocated by Jane Jacobs, who insists the city is a complex ‘ecosystem’ in which urban spaces are gradually improved through community investment and non-centralized planning (Tyrnauer). The experience of urban life, this essay intends to argue, is normally defined by the equilibrium created by these competing ideological positions; but recently, the development of new technology and the increasing influence of digitization, has favored the ‘top-down’ model of city planning. The consequence is that the experience of urban life in the twenty-first-century, is defined by the structure and order imposed by omnipotent architects and developers. The first section of this article will use Zadie Smith’s White Teeth to give shape, through drawing on literary examples, the ambitions and characteristics of the diametrically opposed models of urban planning represented by Jacobs and Moses. It will then show how the latter model of regeneration takes form in Benjamin Markovits’ You Don’t Have to Live Like This, and the way technology is utilized by Robert James to enforce his ‘top-down’ gentrification of Detroit. And finally, it will use Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad, to highlight the totalistic way in which urban life is experienced when technology facilitates the Moses and Le Corbusier approach towards urban planning. In short, this essay is an exploration of the ways twenty-first-century fiction depicts the dangers of urban life which has been informed by the fatal combination of technology and despotic leadership. 

It is first necessary to give shape to the type of urban development practiced by Le Corbusier and Robert Moses; and in Smith’s White Teeth, the Chalfens, a particularly self-satisfied middle class family, can be seen as literary parallels to these omnipotent architectural figures. Owen Hatherely explains that these despots were characterized by their attempts to ‘play God’ and ‘superimpose’ their own logic onto the fabric of the city (Hatherely 13). In a similar way, when we are introduced to the Chalfens, Joyce describes her husband Marcus, as someone who ‘didn’t just make money’, but who ‘created beings’ and ‘went to the edges of God’s imagination [making] mice Yahweh could not conceive of’ (Smith 311). Like Moses and Le Corbusier, Marcus sees it as his personal role to ‘play God’, and artificially interfere with naturally occurring life forms, to make abnormal structures like ‘mice with webbed feet’ or ‘mice with rabbit genes’ (311). The parallel continues: Moses famously stated, ‘you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs’ (Tyrnauer). The implication clearly being that while he recognised his housing projects adversely affected settled communities, he considered their uprooting secondary to the goal of urban development and progress. In White Teeth, the activists who oppose Marcus’ research, the ‘horrible people Joyce had to shoo from the door with a curtain pole’, are like the uprooted communities, in that they supposedly fail to grasp ‘the simple fact’ that Marcus’ experiments are carried out with ‘humanity in mind’ (Smith 312). The Chalfens are emblematic of the domineering architectural mindset, and like Moses and Le Corbusier, they dismiss legitimate criticism against their artificial interference with organic orders, as the unavoidable protestations of luddites. Another characteristic of this model of urban planning, is the desire to form ‘monocultures’, by destroying ‘human-networks’ and replacing them ‘with emptiness and formality’ (Hatherely 13). Joyce, who can’t avoid the sterility of her middle class privilege, admits that ‘sometimes there seemed nothing to improve, nothing to cultivate’ in her family life (314). Hence, her salivation when the opportunity arises to make a project out of Millat and Irie; to turn them into manikins, similar to how Moses would homogenize a site of urban diversity (314). Indeed, she views the two children the way she does ‘her Garter Knight delphinium’, as objects to be cultivated, and their difference nursed into clinical uniformity (314). The Chalfen family in White Teeth are therefore remarkably analogous to Le Corbusier and Moses, and are useful literary reference points in articulating a mentality towards city planning which privileges control and order over diversity and organic growth. 

In opposition to the orthodox, top-down attitude towards urban development, stands Jacobs’ notion of cities as ‘productive ecosystems’, in which she thinks ‘thousands of different actors’ should ‘spontaneously come together in an uncoordinated way’ (Tyrnauer). In her book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jacobs observed that ‘under the seeming disorder of the old city, wherever the old city is working successfully, is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the streets and the freedom of the city’ (Jacobs 50). Smith’s White Teeth also reflects this more dynamic model for urban development, where communities, through a shared engagement with urban spaces, organically improve and bring coherence to the city. While in Whitechapel, the Iqbal family, who consist of first and second generation migrants, are exposed to Enoch Powell’s oppressive speech encouraging urgent action against immigrants, to establish order in communities (Smith 62). In moving to Willesden, however, we see Alsana resolve racial barriers through engagement with public facilities and urban spaces. Initially prejudiced herself, denouncing other ‘minorit[ies] she disliked’, Alsana soon forms an important relationship with Clara, a Jamaican, where the two go for ‘picnics and outings’, and to the cinema to watch ‘French movies where Alsana’ would cover ‘her eyes at the suggestion of nudity’ (65, 74).  In making use of public spaces, like parks and cinemas, Alsana and Clara reflect Jacobs’ model of urban development, where, as Hatherley points out, shared spaces become ‘social centres’, and neighborhoods can be prosperous without the intervention of developers like Moses and Le Corbusier (Hatherley 13). Another example of this is ‘O Connell’s’, which Smith describes as ‘the kind of place family men come to for a different kind of family’, and which Archie and Samad make their ‘home from home’ (Smith 184). Smith further writes that ‘there are reasons why O’Connell’s is an Irish pool house run by Arabs with no pool tables […] But you need to hang around for that kind of information’ (184). Hatherley explains of Jacobs, that one of her main arguments was that ‘cities can and should be understood on foot, by ordinary people’, as this was the only way of understanding the value and potential of ‘bottom-up’ regeneration (Hatherley 13). In reference to White Teeth, through its emphasis that ‘you need to hang around’ to understand O’Connell’s, Smith’s book highlights that cities are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be understood from the aerial perspective, which most planners and architects design from. In short then, the models of urban development represented by Moses and Jacobs both work alongside each other in White Teeth, and the book therefore illustrates how cities are normally experienced by the interaction between these two competing visions.  

In Benjamin Markovits’ You Don’t Have to Live Like This, however, we see the Jacobs model of urban development become increasingly dominated by the invasive approach practiced by Moses and Le Corbusier. As Johnny Miller observes, Markovits’ novel, which is based on real-life attempts to revitalize Detroit, highlights that many of its neighborhoods were ‘middle-class’ and only ‘seen through the eyes of others as slums or ghettos because of the colour of the people who lived there’ (Miller). Indeed, in his presentation of the relationship between Nolan, an ‘original Detroiter’, and Marnie, one of Robert James’ friends from Yale; the regeneration project is revealed by Markovits to be forceful and oblivious to the real needs of the people in the city (Markovits 39). When Marnie first moves to the house Robert James has picked out for him on Johanna Street, his cohort of electricians acquired through nepotism, need to ‘shut off the electricity’ in the neighborhood ‘for a couple of hours’ (67). Nolan responds to their ‘courtesy call’ saying, ‘If you need to shut down the street, you may do so at my convenience. Now is not a convenient time for me’, but nevertheless, the electricians proceed to ‘shut down the street’ (68). James Baldwin famously observed that urban development projects similar to Moses and James’, were a form of ‘Negro Removal’, and the conflict between Marnie and Nolan, is indicative of this remark, in that it sees Nolan, a black inhabitant of Detroit, placed secondary to the needs of the white settlers (Baldwin 42). Nat Segnit elaborates on this, arguing that the urban development that occurs in Markovits’ novel, is a form of ‘ethnic colonialism’, and that the neighborhoods that ‘make up New Jamestown are predominantly white and middle-class, in a city that is neither’ (Segnit 19). Indeed, Nolan acknowledges this aspect of James’ project, and despite the consensus amongst the settlers gentrifying Detroit, that ‘old Detroit blacks should be grateful’ for the ‘pushing up of property prices and giving some of them domestic employment’, he explains the reality to Marnie, saying: ‘How much money have you people brought into the city that you didn’t spend on yourselves’ (Markovits 151, 317). The urban planning practiced by Moses and Le Corbusier deliberately ‘flattened communities’, to ensure interaction with urban spaces that subscribed to their architectural ideals (Hatherely 13). In Markovits’ novel, Robert James similarly encourages the demolition of existing communities, to make room for his neo-colonial ‘development model’ (Markovits 29).  

	While the experience of urban life is normally kept in balance by the competition between Jacobs and Moses’ models for urban development; Robert James’ ‘early settlers’ program in Detroit, highlights the way online platforms and virtual communities, have increasingly allowed for the dominance of Moses’ ‘top-down’ form of planning (53). Theresa Enright explains how the ‘proliferation of technology-led startup entrepreneurship in cities and metropolitan regions’ has ‘ended up reinforcing existing socio-spatial inequalities’ (Enright 47). In You Don’t Have to Live Like This, James’ ‘Groupon model for gentrification’ confirms Enright’s argument, in that his online site, ‘Starting-from-scratch-in-America’, encourages select groups to come together and ‘bid’ for ‘houses and plots of land like an airline check-in chart’ (Markovits 17, 57). Not only does this site allow for decisions to be made about the development of Detroit without the consultation of communities who already exist there, but it also discourages the organic and participatory development of neighborhoods, as advocated for by Jacobs. Keith Hampton further explains that ‘mobile phones make those who are already familiar always available; they connect people with existing members of their social network’, but to the point where ‘intense participation in closed networks [is] at the expense of broader social participation’ (Hampton 705). The group selected by Robert James from his Yale days to help him develop Detroit, including Marnie, Beatrice and Walter, are indicative of the ‘closed network’ outlined by Hampton; and Marnie’s observation that, ‘we sat around all day looking at Facebook, deciding who would get to join our village’, clearly indicates the role of technology in allowing for this non-inclusive and deliberately in opposition to Jacobs ‘bottom-up’ regeneration (Markovits 57). Mobilizations of people, like James’ are successful when ‘barriers to participation’ are removed, and in Markovits’ novel, technology is the means by which James removes barriers for his urban-renewal project (Klandermans 519). Ultimately then, You Don’t Have to Live Like This reveals the way urban space, through a growing influence of technology, is becoming increasingly dominated by a model of urban development, that like Moses’, is forceful and intentionally exclusive. 
In the last chapter of A Visit from the Goon Squad Jennifer Egan depicts a future society where the combination of omnipotent planning and technology, as seen in Markovits’ novel, has reached new heights, and encouraged urban life to be experienced in a controlled and pre-determined way. Robert Moses intended for people to interact with the city in a way which, as Hatherley points out, reflected his own vision of how ‘cities should be’ (Hatherley 13). In her presentation of the Scotty Hausmann concert, Egan hints at the way surveillance technology might allow figures, like Moses, to achieve this objective. Katherine Johnston argues that in Egan’s novel, people are aware that their ‘private actions and interactions are monitored’ but in a way that ‘remains vague and unthreatening’ (Johnston 164). Indeed, when Alex is looking for his wife in the audience of the concert, he observes that ‘it took many minutes of scanning that section of the crowd with his zoom to actually spot her’, and that ‘in the process’ he picked up the ‘tearstained faces of adults, the elated, scant-toothed grins of toddlers, and young people’ (Egan 345). The impression Egan gives in describing Alex ‘scanning’ the crowd is, as Johnston correctly remarks, that of a society which has normalized constant surveillance. The problem with this, as John Lanchester explains, is that when ‘cameras in our cities’ are no longer ‘passive, but part of a connected network offering real-time surveillance and supervision’, people begin to both, knowingly and unknowingly ‘self-censor, self-monitor’ and ‘self-supervise’ (Lanchester 6). Hyper-surveillance therefore subconsciously affects the way people interact with urban space, and this is palpable with Alex at the Scotty Hausmann concert, who notes: ‘choppers were converging overhead, flogging the air with a sound [he] hadn’t been able to bear in the early years […] but [that] over time he’d gotten used to’ and that ‘their military cackle felt weirdly appropriate’ (Egan 339). Pankaj Mishra states that ‘Egan fully realises her vision of the impersonal tyranny of a mass, technicised society’ in A Visit from the Goon Squad, and indeed, the book highlights the way in which omnipotent figures, through surveillance and the resultant effect of ‘self-supervision’, are able to subliminally encourage people to interact with urban spaces in pre-determined ways (Mishra 27). 
The use of internet censorship and targeted media campaigns also informs and restricts where and when people choose to exist in cities. Lanchester points to the ‘Umbrella Protests’ in Hong Kong, as an example of how the Chinese government through the ‘systematic use of counter propaganda’ and ‘internet censorship’ was able to prevent protests on the streets in ‘mainland China’. He further explains how all of this technology ‘exists in the West’, but rather than being state controlled, it is ‘in the hands of private companies’, which exploit it to ‘make us click on ads and buy stuff’ (Lanchester 5, 9). In A Visit from the Goon Squad Egan similarly shows how powerful figures in the media industry like Bennie Salazar, use ‘sophisticated and ubiquitous forms of data collection’ to decide where and when individuals come into contact with urban spaces (Johnston 158). Indeed, Bennie says to Alex, ‘it’s not about sound anymore. It’s not about music. It’s about reach’; a clear acknowledgement that he intends to manipulate technology as a way of influencing how many people come to his outdoor performance (Egan 319). Bennie relies on Alex to use ‘parrots to create ‘authentic’ word of mouth for Scotty Hausmann’s first live concert’ (319, 322). The ‘parrot’ system is similar to what Lanchester describes with regards to the counter measures taken against the ‘Umbrella Movement’, in that it selects ‘influential and corruptible people’ amongst Alex’s ‘15, 896 friends’, who will be paid to promote Scotty Hausmann on web platforms, as a way of encouraging people to attend the concert (323). Mishra observes that Egan’s book leaves us with a ‘disturbing sense’ of the ‘unfreedom’ of its characters, and indeed, its lasting impression is that figures like Bennie and Alex, are able to control how people engage and interact with urban space (Mishra 29). This is confirmed when Alex acknowledges ‘that all of these people […] were on their way to hear Scotty Hausmann. Every single one’ and that ‘he’d done it, Christ he was a genius’ (Egan 338). Lanchester describes what happened with the ‘Umbrella Protests’ as a ‘autocratic fantasy, a posthumanist dream’, and Egan’s book similarly shows how the combination of technology and imposing leadership like Bennie and Alex’s, which is reflective of Moses, has dominated how people interact with urban space (Lanchester 6).  
In The Death and Life of Great American Cities Jacobs likens urban space to a dance, or in her words, ‘an intricate ballet’ where ‘individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose and orderly whole’ (Jacobs 50). The experience of urban life is the product of this ideological position kept in balance by the attitude towards urban space represented by Robert Moses and Le Corbusier. Indeed, Hatherley gives evidence of this balancing act, explaining how in current society, most administrations attempt to ‘build like Moses with Jane Jacobs in mind’ (Hatherley 13). Using Zadie Smith’s White Teeth, this essay has attempted to elaborate on these two stances on urban space, which are so decisive in determining the way it is experienced. Indeed, Smith’s depiction of the Chalfens and the Iqbal family existing parallel to one another, reveal how Moses and Jacobs’ behaviorisms are prevalent in most cities – in this case London. In Benjamin Markovits’ You Don’t Have to Live Like This, however, an example is given of Detroit, as to what happens when this balance is tipped towards one side: settled communities, like Nolan’s, become uprooted because there is no requirement to compromise with the likes of Jacobs. And while Markovits’ novel hints at the role of technology in better facilitating the Moses approach towards urban development; it is Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad, which fully throws into light the consequences of when despotic planning is given free rein in urban spaces through technological platforms. Twenty-first-century fiction then, in the time between Smith’s publication and more recently Markovits and Egan’s, has seen an increasing awareness in how technology has facilitated a Robert Moses inclined experience or urban life.</p></div>
