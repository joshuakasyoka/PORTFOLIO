        <div class="text"><p>In Modernist Fiction: An Introduction (1992) Randall Stevenson acknowledges the way in which modernist writing exhibits significant hostility towards clocks and the sense of temporality they represent. Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent (1907) is no exception to this, and in the novel, Chief Inspector Heat confronts ideas about the chronological clock, specifically remarking that there exist ‘unexpected solutions in continuity, sudden holes in space and time’. Heat’s views, more broadly, can be seen as literary reflections on the concerns raised in Henri Bergson’s Time and Free Will (1889) about the ways in which clocks and clockwork obscure the heterogeneous nature of individually experienced time, by dividing it ‘into equal portions’. Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times (1936) similarly engages with these anxieties, and in its representation of the increased mechanisation of labour, it shows how the individual is forced to experience time, not as true to their consciousness, but rather, as Bergson says, something ‘measurable’ and ‘homogenous’. The first section of this article therefore intends to look more specifically at the ways Conrad and Chaplin’s work reveal the unease in the early twentieth-century about the demands placed on the individual by standardized time. It will then refer to Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935) to assess how both The Secret Agent and Modern Times challenge conceptions of sequential time through experimentation in their respective mediums: Chaplin with filmic techniques, and Conrad by subverting the traditional structure of the novel. And finally, through an analysis of the satirical and comical components of both works, it will try to comprehend each writer’s stance on the potential for the individual to overcome the constraints of clock time. In short then, this article is an exploration into how literature and film of the twentieth century engages with Bergsonian notions of time; ultimately arguing that while Chaplin sees escape for the individual from mechanical time, Conrad is more affirmative about its dominance over both the individual and society.

Bergson uses the term ‘pure duration’ in Time and Free Will to refer to how the individual experiences time internally. Not as linear, where time ‘takes the form of a continuous line or a chain, the parts of which touch without penetrating each other’, but rather, as an ‘organic whole’. By which he proposes that time, or ‘duration’, is formed when the ‘ego lets itself live’, past blends into present, and ‘a succession of qualitative changes […] melt into and permeate one another, without precise outlines’. In The Secret Agent Conrad suggests the industrial and economic developments of the early twentieth-century, which encouraged the systemization of time, pose an affront to ‘pure duration’ as Bergson describes it. Indeed, most of the characters in the book are presented as bound to the temporality of either their work or larger institutional systems. Winne and Verloc’s shop selling ‘nondescript packages’ and ‘photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls’, for example, exists in the liminal space between domestic and work life. The ‘door of the shop’ is described as ‘the only means of entrance to the house’ and a ‘bell’ which is hung on the door is used to summon Verloc, at any given moment, who ‘would issue hastily from the parlour at the back’ (14). Verloc and Winnie’s shop can almost be seen as a physical manifestation of the psychological state of the twentieth-century worker: permanently bound to the time pressures of working life, even when off-duty, and forced to submit to the sound of the ‘bell’ or ‘clock’ whose ‘precise hours’ Stevenson explains ‘had indeed become a kind of curse’. Perhaps a more affirmative suggestion in the book that systematic temporalities had merged into the personal, is Conrad’s constant referral to his characters as inanimate and material objects: the ‘clatter of the bell’ rings and ‘Mr Verloc obeyed woodenly, stony eyed, and like an automaton’. George Lukács mentions how the ‘qualitative’ nature of clock time encourages the worker to become ‘wholly separated from his total human personality’. And indeed, despite Verloc’s primary role as a government agent, a position suggesting autonomy, he is regardless presented by Conrad as dehumanised in having to mechanically attend the temporal pressures of his work. 
In Chaplin’s Modern Times a similar portrayal of sequential time imposing itself on the individual, is enacted by his famous on-screen character, the ‘Tramp’ (Chaplin). Bergson explains how clock-time almost creates a ‘second self […] which obscures the first, a self whose existence is made up of distinct moments’. In the famous sequence of Chaplin’s film, where the Tramp is consumed by the machinery he is working with, this ‘second self’ is comically rendered. Indeed, juxtaposed are the Tramp’s human habits – itching himself, talking to his overseer and becoming distracted with a bee – and the constant movement of the conveyor belt. The demands of his physical labour, force him to separate himself as Bergson says, into ‘distinct moments’ in order to oblige the machine, and he is thus prohibited from experiencing himself according to the actual duration of his conscious processes. When the president of ‘Electro Steel Corp’, demands: ‘section five speed it up’, the Tramp has no choice but to further adjust his time to the time of the machine. Inevitably, we see him become one with the inner mechanics, passing through it as if he himself is another cog. Chaplin therefore actualises the process whereby, as Lukács notes, ‘rational mechanization extends right into the worker’s soul’. The worker conforms to the systematic ticking of the clock, and the movement of the machine, forgoing any sense of psychological or personal time. Chaplin further exaggerates this imposition of clock-time on the working individual, by drawing parallels between factory and prison life. While at the prison, having been arrested on communist charges, the Tramp is subject to temporal regulation: marching to the eating chamber and back to the prison cell, with the ‘prison yard’ sign post lurking in the background as a further suggestion of the segmentation of time. This ordering of the individual according to the clock, familiar in penitentiary settings, shares similarities with the Tramp’s experience of the factory, where he is presented marching into work with the president watching his movements from a screen, like in a panopticon prison. Chaplin’s suggestion then, is clearly that the worker of the early twentieth-century, is forced to experience time, as would a prisoner: foreordained by bureaucratic systems, and not at all according to the Bergsonian notion of pure heterogeneous time. Having established that both The Secret Agent and Modern Times express anxiety about the effects of mechanical time on the individual; it is necessary to examine the ways in which their work is also an exploration on the potential for the literary and filmic mediums to challenge the chronology of the clock. Indeed, in Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction Benjamin comments on arts ability to make visible the reality of life: ‘our railroad stations and our factories appeared to have us locked up hopelessly. Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder’. While Benjamin’s optimism for art’s role in representation was very much associated with film and the camera; in The Secret


	 Agent, Conrad employs quasi modernist techniques in attempt to show more accurately, how psychological time operates. Indeed, Stevenson explains how the novel disrupts ‘chronology through the idiosyncrasies of characters’ inner consciousness’ and the amalgamation of ‘past and present, to incorporate earlier experience into present thought’. This technique occurs throughout the novel, but is perhaps most significantly felt when Verloc says to Winne: ‘You go to bed now. What you want is a good cry’. The words suggest that the two characters occupy the same space and time, but then Conrad presents us with Winnie’s deep reflections and conscious thoughts, allowing us to see how she experiences, in the room with Verloc, not sequential time, but psychological time. She reflects on her affection for Stevie, ‘brushing the boy’s hair and tying his pinafores’; the romance with a ‘young man’ who drifted away ‘while she averted her eyes tearfully’; and the relationship with Verloc, ‘security for Stevie loyally paid for on her part’. This past, as Stevenson correctly notes, comes flooding into the present: ‘A few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been uttered’ by Verloc, and the effect is that a more complete representation of how time is experienced by the individual is represented. Gerald Genette uses the word ‘anachrony’ to refer to when narrative deviates from presenting the chronological order in which an event has occurred. He explains this is a valuable asset utilised in the novel, and indeed, in The Secret Agent it allows Conrad to manipulate time, and present it in a way that is less mechanical, but more true to the Bergsonian model. 

Benjamin’s concerns about the effects of increased mechanisation in the early twentieth-century are moderated by his optimism regarding new technology and its potential for facilitating artistic expression. Indeed, talking about the camera, he explains that ‘a different nature opens itself to the camera than opens to the naked eye – if only because an unconsciously penetrated space is substituted for a space consciously explored by man’. Indeed, in Modern Times Chaplin manipulates the camera’s technology in an attempt to curate an experience of time for the viewer that is not linear, but constantly modulating. Lawrence How suggests this is achieved through the editing of the film which forces a viewing ‘at a pace determined by the director’. For example, when the Tramp is in the back of a police car with the Gambit, a crash occurs, and in his presentation of the tilting car sharply contrasted with the image of the two figures lying on the floor, the viewer of the film is forced to accept the fracture in the narrative sequence, and prevented from experiencing the events of the film linearly. Elizabeth Yukins, talks about the ‘productivity of disharmony’, and ‘strategies to fragment and reconfigure the structure of linear narrative’ to ‘extend the representational possibilities of time’. Modern Times in its sharp editing of different scenes, therefore exemplifies Yukins’ ideas of structural reconfiguration. This is further achieved in the way in which the film ‘controls the audience’s gaze’. The camera, through the framing of scenes, and ‘it’s lowering and lifting’, bringing certain characters into focus, encourages the viewer to engage with their respective experiences of personal time (Benjamin). Having escaped the police car, the Gambit and the Tramp sit outside an idealized American bungalow; the camera moves to the Tramp, before entering into a dream sequence in which he and the Gambit have actualized the American dream. As the dream sequence ends, the camera moves left from the Tramp back to the Gambit, achieving what Conrad does to an extent in The Secret Agent, with Winnie’s anachronistic remembrance of the past: an insight into personal time. The technology of the camera is therefore utilised, as Benjamin says, to introduce ‘us to the unconscious optic as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulse’. Modern Times can therefore be seen, as The Secret Agent can, an attempt to resist the chronological clock, and render time how the individual experiences it. 

While Conrad and Chaplin both engage with Bergson’s concerns about clock time, and pose challenges to it through the non-linear narratology of their work. The satirical and comic tone of their respective outputs, reveal different stances regarding the ability for the individual to escape the constraints of mechanized time. Glyn White talking about the role of comedy in the 1930s establishes two different comic forms: the ‘anarchistic comedy’, which ‘in a carnivalesque manner’ rejects ‘the constrictions of society, offering glimpses of more progressive visions of the future’, and the ‘affirmative comedy’, in which ‘the individual learns to negotiate with the requirements of society’. Conrad’s The Secret Agent can be productively compared to the affirmative comedy, in that it satirically shows there is no escape from mechanised society, and that the individual who attempts to resist it, will most likely be faced with some form of erasure. Indeed, Benjamin Lewis Robinson confirms that in the novel ‘the pervading sense is one of the hopelessness of all direction’. Verloc, and his supposed anarchists, are satirically presented as incapable of enacting any kind of change, with Heat saying he ‘could never bring himself to consider’ their activity ‘seriously’. And ultimately, when Stevie unknowingly attempts to blow up the Greenwich Observatory, Conrad notes it ‘did not show as much as the faintest crack’. The dark humor which underlines The Secret Agent, is therefore akin to the affirmative comedy in that Conrad reinforces that the individual has no choice but to ‘negotiate with the requirements of society’, and the clock time on which it is centered. On the other hand, Modern Times conforms to the ‘carnivalesque manner’ of the anarchist comedy, by confronting the ‘inhuman nature of mechanized work’ with slap-stick humour. Chaplin ridicules the machine, most specifically, when the Tramp is subjected to the ‘Billows feeding machine’, which is promoted by ‘the mechanical salesman’ as ‘a practical device which automatically feeds your men while at work’. The ineffectuality of the machine, when tested on the Tramp – throwing soup on his face –  is Chaplin’s attempt to undermine the notion that the human can be made to abide by mechanical time. And as White says, ‘glimpses of more progressive visions of the future’, are envisaged in the film when the Tramp and Gambit walk off into the distance with a mountain in the background; ‘at least they have each other’. As such, while Chaplin conforms to the anarchistic comedy, and offers an optimistic look at the potential for the worker to escape the pressures of clock time, Conrad, in his bleak satire, reflects on society’s unyielding grip on the worker, and how they experience time. 

In short then, the scepticism towards clock-time expressed by Inspector Heat in The Secret Agent can be taken as a useful point of departure for understanding literature and film’s engagement with the effects of systemised time on the individual in the early twentieth-century. Indeed, in both Conrad and Chaplin’s works concerns are raised with regards to the way in which an increasingly mechanised society imposes a homogenous and regulated system of time, as symbolized by the clock, onto its workers. An encroachment on the psychological ‘duration’, which Bergson in his Time and Free Will, explains that the individual normally experiences. And while both Modern Times and The Secret Agent employ literary and filmic devices to challenge ideas of chronology, reflecting Benjamin’s optimism for artistic expression in the ‘age of mechanical reproduction’. This article has ultimately intended to show that Chaplin, in his comical rendering of the individual in amongst machines differs from Conrad, who is affirmative that there is no relief from the ticking of the clock.</p></div>
