        <div class="text"><p>In representing the conflict and pain experienced by others there is a danger of becoming a voyeur, a tourist of suffering, or at least a propagator of false information. A large question therefore resides in the moral implications of representing the misfortune of others, especially if it is done from a position of privilege. Rob Nixon has written extensively on the role of the ‘writer activist’, which he describes as category of writers that embrace the ‘challenges of translating across chasms of class, race, gender, and nation’, and who ‘are enraged by injustices they wish to see redressed’. He asks how these writers engage with global violations while also challenging their own privilege, or in his words, the ‘privilege of the visible’. Indeed, in representing the pain experienced by others, especially through literary means, writers must acknowledge their fortunate place, at a distance from the suffering they wish to expose. This article therefore intends to explore the ways in which the graphic novel attempts to overcome the moral problematics of representing others’ pain. Linda Hutcheon explains that a defining characteristic of postmodern writing is that it is ‘premised on a challenge to the realist notion of representation that presumes transparency of the medium’, and a self-reflexivity that acknowledges the shortcomings of narrative authority. Spiegelman, Lefèvre and Sacco all employ postmodern metafictional components in their work as a way of drawing attention to the constructedness of their respective narrative accounts. In Maus metafiction is used by Spiegelman to abandon any claims that his graphic novel is an exhaustive account on the events of the Holocaust. Lefèvre’s The Photographer similarly employs postmodern devices as a means of drawing attention to his role as a naïve, Western photographer in Afghanistan. And in Palestine, Sacco frequently makes reference to his own impartiality, and the incompleteness of his narrative reportage while in the region.      The historian Dominik LaCapra observes that in representing the Holocaust, outside the role of the witness, there is a danger in venturing towards morally insensitive stylistic excess. Or more specifically, that in the reconstruction of traumatic events, often in the form of fiction or art, there is a tendency to do so in ‘terms of an insufficiently differentiated, rashly generalized, hyperbolic aesthetic of the sublime’. Schindler’s List (1994) directed by Steven Spielberg, or even the more recent work by László Nemes, Son of Saul (2015) illustrate this aesthetic excess, or what LaCapra terms the ‘dubious consequence’ of representation. Indeed, the aestheticized treatment of the Holocaust in both of these films, some critics argue, takes away from the real trauma of the event. Comparing the two, Stefan Grissemann has asserted that while Nemes’ ‘art-house experiment refuses sentimentality and character identification’ making it the ‘antitheses of Spielberg’s Holocaust’, Son of Saul ‘remains at a distance from the reality it reaches for’. Literary critic, Andreas Huyssen, has similarly observed the way in which the culture industry, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, tended towards ‘Brechtian parable plays’, which abstracted the traumatic events with the intention of creating a ‘distance’ from which spectators could develop a rational understanding of the Holocaust. However, the ‘avant-gardist’ approach towards representation, Huyssen argues was ‘ironic’, for while it ‘enabled playwrights to attack the Third Reich’ it also ‘prevented audience identification with the historic specificity of Jewish suffering’. Like the Brechtian plays of the 1950s, Art Spiegelman’s Maus uses cats and mice allegorically to tell the story of Jewish persecution at the hands of Nazi Germany. The novel, with its visual components and heavily stylized pages, is therefore positioned dangerously close to the cinematic experimentation of Spielberg and Nemes. However, the metafictional components included in Maus are utilized by Spiegelman to abandon any claims of totality of representation, and through showing the processes he worked through in publishing Maus, the novel party resolves the issue of representing others’ pain.     Hilary Chute argues that ‘the most metafictional section’ of Maus is the chapter ‘Time Flies’ which allows Spiegelman to reflect on the ‘viability’ of his ‘present project’. Indeed, the first page opens with Art wearing a mouse mask, looking towards the reader saying: ‘In September 1986, after 8 years of work, the first part of Maus was published. It was a critical and commercial success’. In wearing the mask, Spiegelman is confessing to his concerns about profiteering from the suffering of so many deaths (it suggests he is only pretending to be Jewish), and in the next frame we see him at his drawing board, looking conscious-stricken, with a pile of bodies underneath his chair. The inclusion of himself in the narrative, discussing the book we are reading, allows Spiegelman to tackle directly, any claims that Maus attempts at a transparency of events, or a complete authentic account of the Holocaust. Indeed, as the chapter progresses, Art is asked by multiple journalists about the success of his book: ‘tell our viewers what message you want them to get’, to which his responses become increasingly desperate and confused: ‘I have no idea’, ‘Who am I to say’ and ‘Huh?’. In the course of these questions, we see the body of Art transform from a full sized adult into that of a child, who eventually screams ‘Wah … I want my mommy’ (202). In depicting himself as an infant, Spiegelman thus attempts to highlight his own distance and alienation from the Holocaust, and his acknowledgement that he cannot comprehend the entirety or complexity of the events. Later in the chapter, the infantile Spiegelman talks to his psychologist, saying: ‘My father worked in a tin shop near the camp. I have no idea what kind of tools and stuff to draw. There’s no documentation’ (206). Hathaway describes one of the major characteristics of postmodern ethnography as its tendency to ‘start from a place of defeat: how can a single account convey the dynamic, multivalent, contested nature of any cultural group or phenomenon’. In pointing out, as he does by admitting to his psychologist, that he doesn’t know what a ‘tin shop near the camp’ would have looked like, as well as consistently outlining his own narrative shortcomings, Spiegelman drops all claims of a complete and accurate representation of his father’s experience of the Holocaust. As such, metafiction is effectively used in the novel, to overcome the problematics of making an aesthetic experience, as La Capra warns, of others’ pain.Huyssen’s essay looking at Maus in relation to what Adorno famously claimed about representations of the Holocaust - ‘To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric’ - further argues that Spiegelman, by drawing on comics ‘as a mass cultural genre’ and saturating his text ‘with modernist techniques of self-reflexivity’ avoids morally insensitive representation. One such technique Spiegelman uses for achieving this self-reflexivity, according to Huyssen, is the inclusion of ‘irony, shock’ and ‘black humor’ in the novel (81). Indeed, an example of this is in the section of the Maus titled ‘Prisoner of the Hell Planet: A Case History’, in which Spiegelman presents himself in highly stylized, almost wood-cut like prints, dressed in the clothing of an Auschwitz prisoner. By representing himself in such clothing, Spiegelman is ironically embracing what so many Holocaust representations attempt to avoid: over-stepping the mark, and giving too subjective a version of events which then compromise the authenticity of the historic account given. Indeed, despite having asserted in interviews that ‘I’ve never been through anything like that’, in reference to the Holocaust; by referring to himself as a victim, Spiegelman is highlighting the way in which he brings his own personal history into his representation, and his feelings of resentment at having been the child of Holocaust survivors. Huyssen has said that: ‘the memories of Auschwitz do not only claim Anja; they also envelop the son born years after the war’. On the next page of the integrated comic - Prisoner of the Hell Planet -  Spiegelman announces behind prison bars: ‘Well, mom. If you’re listening … Congratulations! You’ve committed the perfect crime … you put me here … shorted all my circuits… cut my nerve endings … and crossed my wires! ... your murdered me me. Mommy’. The referral to his mother as the ‘murderer’ is deeply ironic, considering her status as a survivor of the concentration camps, and consequential victim of suicide. Yet the inclusion of these ironic portrayals and subversions of who is victim and perpetrator, dramatically emphasises the non-objectivity of the historic account given by Spiegelman. No representation which attempts at complete transparency would venture to make the insinuation that victims of the Holocaust are ‘murderers’. Hathaway has stated that Spiegelman’s negative portrayal of himself, as we have seen in this section, is an ‘acknowledgement of the difficulty – if not the impossibility – of letting fieldwork subjects speak for themselves’. Indeed, the presentation of his father and mother’s experience of the Holocaust has the traces of his words all over it.  As such, Maus offers a representation of the Holocaust which avoids largely the moral pitfalls of depicting the suffering ‘of others, through the inclusion, and criticism of himself in the text. Or as Linda Hutcheon has noted on postmodern representational practices, Maus can be seen to ‘refuse to stay neatly within accepted conventions and traditions’, instead employing metafictional techniques which refuse ‘control and mastery’. 
	The Photographer and Palestine similarly struggle with the moral challenge of representing conflict from the perspective of an outsider, or more specifically, the perspective of tourist and travel writer. This has been picked up by Monica Chiū in her essay on travel narratives and comics, in which she asserts that ‘while travel writers might be aware of […] global inequalities, they are often unaware of how the act of writing about travel itself engenders contemporary power formations that are unequal’. Indeed, in his representation of Afghani turmoil as someone from the West, Lefèvre unavoidably situates himself in the contentious and extensive debate on neo-colonial and imperializing gazes, as does Sacco in his presentation of Palestine. Linda Nochlin in The Politics of Vision (1991) outlines the West’s historic tendency to invent, through supposedly ‘objective reportage’ an image of the ‘Orient’. Through a deliberate process of selection and exclusion, she explains artists and writers have artificially constructed, in their own terms, a vision of the East as ‘Other’. To such an extent that ‘The white man, the Westerner’ is always present in depictions of the East, and that it is through his gaze that the image of the Oriental world is brought into being. In depicting the suffering of Afghani individuals, partly using the photographic medium, which Sontag explains is built to ‘frame’ and ‘exclude’, The Photographer risks falling into a long tradition, whereby artists and writers have fabricated an image of the East, which disregards the intentions of those being represented. Indeed, Sontag emphasises how some of the most ‘canonical images of early war photography turn out to have been staged, or to have had their subjects tampered with’. Similarly, in Sacco’s narrative account of Palestinian lives, he is in the privileged position of giving shape and form to others’ experiences of suffering, and in control of how their stories are translated into words. In both The Photographer and Palestine, however, Lefèvre and Sacco are careful to make use postmodern metafiction, like Spiegelman does in Maus, to overcome the potentially disastrous consequences of representing the suffering experienced by others without reinforcing and contributing to a neo-colonial rhetoric.Commenting on Orientalism in Western Literature, Said has pointed out the tendency to present ‘the cultural inferiority of the Islamic Orient’ and attempts to ‘perpetuate European dominance’. The Photographer and Palestine expresses an awareness of their relationship to this Western literary tradition, and take careful steps to avoid narrative mastery by detailing the short-comings of their own narrators: Lefèvre and Sacco. In an introduction to The Photographer, Alexis Siegel states ‘We discover Afghanistan through the eyes and camera of [a] photojournalist […] who is admittedly naïve about the geopolitical complexities that he is stumbling into’. Indeed, deciding to abandon the MSF trip, Lefèvre makes the journey from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, expecting the organization to provide guides to help him. On realizing that the guides he has been sent, aren’t the experienced ‘Muji’ which he has been accustomed to throughout his trip, he complains to Odile, a member of the MSF team: ‘Bassir gave me a bunch of useless creeps’, to which she responds, ‘you poor thing! … I can’t really blame him, though. He can’t afford to assign four muji to a guy who’s going back alone. He’s keeping his muji for the winter or sending them with major caravans’. The metafictional presentation of himself in The Photographer demanding special treatment, undermines Lefèvre’s narrative authority, and the reader is encouraged to consider the story and its representations as tainted by Western bias. Lefèvre’s decision to walk to Pakistan also results in a near death experience, where unable to do the most fundamental tasks, like strap luggage to his horse, he becomes stranded in the mountains. His subsequent rescue by a ‘caravan’ headed by a ‘wolf faced’ Afghani, subverts the hierarchy which presumes the Westerner has the most knowledge. Indeed, as Chiū has points out, The Photographer juxtaposes ‘the white protagonists against their non-white counterparts to ask who has power and visibility in the narrative, in which situations, and why?’. In Palestine too, Sacco is eager to point towards his own privilege in representing others’ suffering. In the chapter ‘Refugee Land’, in which he visits a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, he deliberately emphasises his position as tourist: ‘So I saw Gaza, sort of… I did the UNRWA tour, in and out in two hours’, and frequently paints himself in an unsympathetic light: ‘Tomorrow I’m going to another camp, Jabilia … I’d rather not … I’d rather sit around a heater with people like Larry and read Edward Said’.  Sacco’s text is brimming these examples, in which he comes across as insensitive, or apathetic to the hardship which he reports on. The effect is that the reader learns to distrust his narrative, or is at least encouraged to question the authority of his voice, and the claims he makes.In The Photographer Lefèvre frequently represents the process by which he has taken a photograph, and in Palestine too, there are constant referrals throughout the novel, to the way in which Sacco gathers sources and material for his writing. As such, both text encourage a critical engagement with their methods of representation, which contrasts the transparency characteristic of neo-colonial depictions of the East. Sontag explains that photographs have the ‘advantage of uniting two contradictory features’ in that their ‘credentials of objectivity’ are in built, but that they almost always have a ‘point of view’. Lefèvre deliberately highlights that his photographs are not objective reportage, but rather the product of his own decisions and the processes he works through. Waking up from a night’s sleep in the ‘town square of Kantiwa’, Lefèvre sees a photo opportunity, he says: ‘I know I should take a picture, but feel so empty… I fumble in my bag and weakly pull out the first camera I feel… barely frame the picture … there so be it’. On the following page we are presented with one of the most striking photographs in the novel, a picture of two tall Muji standing with a small child beneath them. The narrative account of producing the photograph, which in this incident is inattentively done, allows the reader to question the impartiality behind its creation. It bears the trace of Lefèvre’s input rather than appearing objective, which Nochlin criticizes in previous colonial depictions of the East: the absense of the artist which would ‘give credibility to the ‘realness’ of the work as a whole, to authenticate the total visual field as simple, artless reflection – in this case, of a supposed Oriental reality’. In a later incident, Lefèvre also refers to an effort made by the ‘Wakil’ to get all his men to line up in front of their barracks for a photograph. He then states: ‘all that commotion for a picture they’ll never see’. His reference to the incident, and the commentary on the picture’s creation allows Lèfevre to address one of the central problems of photographing others: the privilege of the photographer over the photographic subject, both in how the picture is created, but also the after-life of the photograph. In Palestine, this is also something Sacco draws attention towards. He highlights the subjectivity, and sometimes lack of input from his subjects, in his narrative account, by depicting the way he gathers material for his novel. In a hospital ward, we see him, camera in hand, moving around hospital beds saying: ‘I’m warming up to my photo op … I’m prowling around looking for angels’. He presents himself as very much a part of the photographic process, intruding in on others’ injuries, rather than a being a neutral by stander. We see that the way he gathers sources is not impartial, but something which very much involves his subjective input. As such, the metafictional inclusion of themselves in the narrative, as well as outlining the process by which the narrative is constructed – both distinctly postmodern techniques – allows Lefèvre and Sacco to forgo the ‘totalizing impulse’ of western literature, and takes strides towards a representation which is, morally, less questionable.In short then, while representing the conflict experienced by others is normally complicated by the privileged position held by the person providing the narrative account. Like artistic accounts of the Holocaust, or depictions of the East, from the perspective of an outsider, which are susceptible to acquiring a colonial gaze. In the graphic novels: Maus, The Photographer and Palestine, metafiction, and the inclusion of the author in the narration, allows for a self-reflexivity which prevents any claim at a totalizing narrative, or authorial voice. In all the texts, the reader is encouraged to mistrust the accuracy of the representation at all points of the narrative, and as such, there is an engagement with the conflict experienced by others that is not tainted by voyeurism, or moral insensitivity.</p></div>
