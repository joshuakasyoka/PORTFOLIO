        <div class="text"><p>In The Country and the City Raymond Williams suggests that as early as the Hellenistic period, the countryside has served as a useful comparison to the ‘internal corruption of the city’ (Williams 47). It has been elevated to mythic status, representing a ‘happier and more natural’ way of life (40). He further argues that the ‘idealization’ of the countryside has functioned fictionally as a reminder of an ‘essential morality’ which could be used to condemn or control the actions of those dwelling in the city (54). What is clear from Williams’ observations is that urban spaces are defined in constant relation to what exists outside the parameters of the city. In both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark urban space is similarly characterized by ideas on peripheral space; in particular, conceptions of the countryside in Patrick White’s novel, and British colonies in the West Indies in Jean Rhys’. As such, the first section of this essay intends to reveal in more detail how people in the Australian city and its suburbs, construct themselves in accordance with ‘romantic notions of the redemptive and restorative qualities of nature’, and how those in London, as seen in Voyage in the Dark, determine their identity by measuring themselves against colonial outposts - such as those in the Caribbean (Murphy 122). It will then explore how White and Rhys undermine the binary structure based on this urban-periphery opposition, which excludes both Eddie Twyborn and Anna Morgan in the respective texts, from the social ontology that surrounds them. Ultimately, as Williams acknowledges in his book, that the countryside serves as a myth for those in the city; this essay will argue that White and Rhys’ literary depictions of the countryside and the colony, work to reveal the myth of peripheral space, and how, it is a fiction used to maintain order and normalcy in urban places.

            In The Twyborn Affair White depicts the Australian city and its suburbs as attempting to emulate the values and qualities thought to be found in the countryside. Andrew McCann sees the suburb in White’s novel – which this essay shall include in its understanding of an urban space – as ‘not a real place’ but a ‘fantasy of a place’, based around a utopian model where ‘romantic pastoralism and modern social engineering come together in a vision of harmony’ (McCann 58). Indeed, the Australian suburbs since their modern incarnation, were bound to aesthetic standards associated with nature, such as gardens and parks. But more importantly, as Graeme Davison points out, they were constructed around certain feminine tropes; in particular, fertility and nurture, due to conceptions of nature as feminine. He explains the suburban home thus became a ‘kind of temple in which the wife ruled as the ‘Angel of the Home’’ (Davison 3). Joanie Golson can be taken as representative of this nature inspired suburbia, where the woman is expected to be ‘feminine’ and a ‘doting wife’ (Lever). In part one of the novel, we see her looking through the window of a villa at Eudoxia Vatatzes, fantasizing about a life where she is not expected to play a gendered role: ‘she stood by the wall watching the scene through the open window, the tears streaming down her cheeks, for joy, from the music she was hearing, and out of frustration from the life she had led, and, it seemed would always lead’ (White 18). Joanie’s position – ‘by the wall’ – moving so as to get a better look at the ‘lithe young woman’, acts as a symbolic reminder to the reader, of her separation and exclusion from life outside of her gendered existence in the Australian suburb (17). At best she can be a voyeur, as in this instance, looking at Eudoxia; or she can dress up, as she remembers she had done with Eadie Twyborn, who had ‘given herself a moustache, dashed off with burnt cork’ (White 20). She can never live, however, outside of her prescribed life in the suburb, where she is expected to be both a wife and heterosexual. Indeed, Susan Lever has pointed out that Joanie creates Eudoxia ‘as a beautiful young woman, associated with gardens, flowers and music’ (Lever). In using the language of the suburbanite, ‘gardens’ and ‘flowers’ in her fantasies of escape, and what would be nefarious love, White further suggests the extent to which Joanie is conditioned by suburban ideas, and of nature as the aesthetic ideal. As such, the Australian suburb, and the behavior of its inhabitants, such as Joanie Golson’s can be seen as heavily influenced by ideas on peripheral space, in this instance, femininity and the aesthetics thought to be found in the natural world. 
            
            In Rhys’ Voyage in the Dark London is similarly shown to define itself in relation to peripheral space; it creates a depraved image of the West Indies, and through comparison, asserts its morally superior character. Anna Snaith argues that urban space in the book is presented by Rhys as containing a ‘palimpsestic awareness of the space behind spaces’ (Snaith 76). Indeed, she shows that London cannot be understood, unless in relation to its colonial outposts, and throughout the book, we see the way in which people in the city overcome concerns regarding what it meant to be English in a time of ‘heightened national anxiety’, by establishing a picture of those in the colonies as ‘Other’ (79). When Anna Morgan describes to Walter Jefferies, where she is from, saying ‘I wanted to make him see what it was like’, detailing the ‘lovely moonlight nights’ where the ‘shadows the moon makes are as dark as sun-shadows’, his own preconceptions about the place prevent any real engagement (Rhys 42). While he acknowledges it may be ‘beautiful’, he ultimately says: ‘I don’t like hot places much. I prefer cold places. The tropics would be altogether too lush for me; I think’ (Rhys 42). For Jefferies, as Klaudia Lee explains, ‘heat’ is associated with ‘sexual lasciviousness’, and by maintaining that he would not like ‘hot places’, and that he prefers the ‘cold’, Jefferies is essentially insisting upon the moral superiority and purity of the English character over that of the Caribbean character (Lee 144). Almost everyone Anna comes into contact with, in fact, is quick to point out the ‘heat’ of the colonies, as if to foreground, the cool and rational qualities intrinsic to the English personality. In describing Anna, Maudie defaults to saying ‘she was born in a hot place’, only later followed by a more specific geographic location: ‘in the West Indies or somewhere, weren’t you, kid? (Rhys 8). The reliance on the colonies for those in the city to understand themselves, is perhaps better illustrated, however, in the prejudice Ethel displays against foreigners. She understands herself as the antitheses of the foreigner, even though she possesses many of the flaws which she ascribes to them. This irony is visibly rendered when Ethel says to Anna ‘I’m a Swedish masseuse … mind you … I don’t mean like some of these dirty foreigners’ (91). Ethel understands herself by creating a fiction in her head, that she is different from those who exists outside of the city, and in unfamiliar countries; a necessary function, as Lee says, for her maintaining ‘her self-proclaimed status of a lady’ (Lee 145). In short then, peripheral space, such as the colonies in the West Indies, allow for London and its inhabitants to find the contours of their identity. 
            
                Having established that in both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark urban identity is grounded by perceptions on peripheral space; it is important to examine the ways in which the two texts challenge this urban-periphery binary structure. McCann explains that a recurrent theme in Australian literature is its resistance to ‘suburban normalcy’ and indeed, White’s novel can be seen as an interrogation of the ‘semiotic and aesthetic’ components which organize the suburb (McCann 62). He breaks down the ‘clearly delineated sex roles’ and ‘signs’ on which the ‘suburban idyll’ depends, and exposes them to be arbitrary constructions which, this essay has argued, have been borrowed from ideals thought to be found in nature.  The themes of cross-dressing which exist throughout the novel, for example, are used by White to parody the signifiers of sexual identification, and to show the irrelevance of ‘gender iconography’ (Stobie 57). In part two of the book, Eddie Twyborn is dressed in Marcia Lushington’s clothes, when he is observed by her husband, who appears to say: ‘I just wanted to tell you, Marce, that the word was wrong- in the poem, I mean … he smiled, and immediately withdrew, not wanting to disturb his wife’s rest’ (White 283). Cheryl Stobie explains that ‘the effect of the masquerade may ensure that the subject passes’, and indeed, Greg Lushington is convinced that he is looking at his wife, ignorant to the fact it is Eddie Twyborn in drag. White thus highlights the way in which signifiers, such as dress, used to fix gender in place are, as Stobie argues, ‘mockable’ and largely an ‘artifice’ (Stobie 57). This categorization of gender is further collapsed by White in his presentation of Monsieur Pelletier, who takes to masturbating when he observes a figures in the sea: ‘unsure whether the stranger, a naked one at that, was a man or a woman’ (White 75). Desire, and sexual attraction, in this instance, cannot be ascribed to that which is purely physical, and we see Pelletier, regardless of the sex of the swimmer, relieved by ‘the trickle of his own cooling sperm’ (74). Stobie explains that White’s novel intends to ‘transgress the expectation of categories’ and suggest a ‘liminal space between confining roles’ (Stobie 57). Indeed, the book disrupts the normalcy and gender structures on which the Australian suburb is formed, and criticizes the absurdity of its rural aspirations.  
            In Voyage in the Dark, in a similar way, Rhys exposes the problematic binary logic of colonial discourse, which leaves Anna – a creole person who is neither black or white, colonized or colonizer – unable to situate herself in both social and cultural terms. Adlai Murdoch argues that Anna is symbolic of the ‘proscriptive policies of the colonial neither/nor’ and the futility of its ‘performative planes’ (Murdoch 257). Indeed, having connections with both England and the West Indies, she belongs in reality to neither place, and throughout the book, there are no attempts made to accommodate her liminality. In maintaining the difference of the colonial figure as ‘Other’, people in urban spaces like London, depended on rigid binaries, and Anna’s ambiguity is therefore presented by Rhys posing a threat to English identity. Or, as Snaith suggests, Anna’s Caribbean affiliation ‘immediately excludes her from the category of Englishwomen’ (Snaith 81). In attempt to overlook her hybrid existence, Klaudia Lee argues Anna is constantly forced into the role of ‘cultural other who exists on sexual desire’ (Lee 144). She points to an example in the text when Jefferies takes her to a ‘semi-public space, the hotel room’ – where Anna is surprised to find a bedroom attached the room in which they have just dined (144). The example highlights that initially innocent when arriving in London, Anna is forced to play the role of the sexually-motivated colonial, which people in city expect and require of her. However, as White breaks down the urban-periphery binary with themes of cross-dressing, in The Twyborn Affair, Rhys similarly shows the ways in which these colonial systems are based on arbitrary constructs. She presents clothes and masquerade in the book as a way for Anna to achieve acceptance, or as Snaith points out, ‘dressing up’ becomes ‘a potential way out of her fixity’ (Snaith 81). While the purchasing of clothes represents for Anna both the possibility of change but also the impossibility, for she needs money to enact the material transformation; what is ultimately apparent is the way in which urban spaces define themselves according to a set of superficial standards, which are not grounded, as they might like to think, on the colonies as genuinely ‘Other’, but rather, on performative categories like dress. 
            In both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark ideas on peripheral spaces are further exposed as no more than imaginative creations. Like Williams explains in The Country and the City, that for those in urban places, there is a ‘mystification of the land’ which does not match up with the ‘rural exploitation’ and ‘instrumental’ treatment of men which actually defines the countryside. White and Rhys’ texts similarly highlight the fictitious nature of the ideals which are represented, for those in the city, by the countryside and West Indian colonies. While the Australian suburb is established around conceptions on the countryside as a ‘kindly mother earth, at once the source of life, of happiness, of wealth, and of power’ in The Twyborn Affair the opposite is shown to be true (Murphy 199). In part two of the book, when Eddie is working as jackeroo in rural Australia, the reader is presented with images of infertility and debauchery. Marcia Lushington, for example, has sexual relationships with Don Prowse and Greg Lushington which are defined by their infertile engagement - none of the children she has survive their infancy. Despite being described as ‘of the land’ by Prowse, her inability to mother a child, sets her apart from the ideal on which the Australian suburb is built, and which she is supposed to embody (White 187). In addition, the heteronormative relationships, and ‘rigidly monitored binarist system of gender and sexuality’ on which the suburb is centered, is shown to be lacking in the Australian countryside. Don Prowse, the farm manager, unable to control his sexual desires when he sees Eddie diving into the river, is drawn to rape him. The Australian suburb’s attempts to emulate the qualities and morals of the countryside are therefore shown by White to be an almost comical aspiration; indeed, it is far more likely that as peripheral space, the country has been fictitiously created, as a means of establishing a sense of ‘normalcy’ in the suburb, and set of moral standards. In Voyage in the Dark the West Indies are similarly created for practical purposes by those in the city, but these creations do not accurately reflect the place. Indeed, in reference to the climate with which the colonies are associated, Anna explains that ‘they exaggerate about the heat’ (Rhys 43). Perhaps more interestingly, however, is that when Anna arrives in London, she too uses the colonies functionally. She becomes nostalgic about the place, creating an image of it in her head, stating: ‘being black is warm and gay, being white is cold and sad’ (Rhys 10). 
            Or as Snaith points out that ‘the sensuality she associates with Jamaica helps to free her from the mechanization of the metropole London’ (Snaith 84). In both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark then, urban space can be seen as largely defined by ideas on peripheral space; but ultimately this space is a fictionally created – it is used to establish the identity of both, the Australian suburb, and metropoles like London.</p></div>
